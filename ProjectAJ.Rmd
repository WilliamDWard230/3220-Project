## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
install.packages("rpart")
library(rpart)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:
The boxplot and plot did not show anything useful, so instead I'm going to analyze the features by themselves
```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)

car_data <- read.csv("bmw.csv")

summary(car_data)

plot(car_data$price, car_data$tax, main = "Car Price vs Tax", xlab="Price", ylab="Tax")

boxplot(tax ~ price, data = car_data, main = "Tax by Price",
        xlab = "Tax", ylab="Price") 

carModel <- rpart(tax ~ price, data = car_data)
summary(carModel)

tax related stuff 

summary(car_data$tax)
hist(car_data$tax, main = "Distribution of Car Tax", xlab = "Tax", col = "blue",border = "white")
boxplot(car_data$tax, data = car_data, main = "Tax", xlab = "Tax")
carModel <- rpart(tax ~ fuelType, data = car_data)
summary(carModel)
// After running this rpart we discover something important 
   Avg tax for electric/hybrid: 79
   Avg tax for pretrol/diesal: 120

price related stuff 
summary(car_data$price)
hist(car_data$price, main = "Distribution of Car Price", xlab = "Price", col = "blue",border = "white")
boxplot(car_data$price, data = car_data, main = "Distibution of Car Price", xlab = "Price")
plot(car_data$price, car_data$engineSize, main = "Car Price vs Engine Size", xlab="Price", ylab="Engine")
carModel <- rpart(price ~ engineSize, data = car_data)
summary(carModel)
//after running rpart it seems that the bigger the engine size,     the higher the price with a split between 1.95, 2.9, and 4,2      liters. 
  For engines < 1.95 avg price: 16,726
  For engines 1.95-2.9 avg price: 20,651
  For engines 2.9-4.2 avg prices: 31,475
  For engines > 4.2 avg prices: 46,536


```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
